## Description

FotoBook is a reverse engineering of Instagram with login/ authentication, profiles, posting, commenting, editing, and following functionality. You can post Images with captions and save them to your profiles collection that will be displayed on the explore page. Users can follow other profiles or search profiles by @usernames. Once registered and logged in you can update your profile username, image, header image, and bio. You will also be able to make posts to your profile and comment on other users' posts. To post a non-live image upload your image to imgur and select the share link of your image while pasting that in the post (don't forget the .jpg). For live images you can copy link addresses and post images or GIFs.
